-- ============================================================================
-- Accumulated booking-fee remittances
--
-- Business rule:
--   * The venue accumulates the full platform booking/service fee on every
--     eligible booking row. Customer/host downpayments are a separate amount.
--   * A court owner prepares one remittance on or after the 14th. The database
--     freezes all fees earned through the exact server timestamp of that call.
--   * Fees earned after that cutoff remain unclaimed for the next due cycle.
--   * A remittance reaches SETTLED only after a system owner accepts enough
--     payment proof to cover its frozen amount.
--
-- This migration intentionally leaves public.weekly_fees and its history
-- untouched. Any booking already claimed by weekly_fee_id, billed_at, or a
-- paid weekly_fees.billed_refs history is excluded from the new ledger; unpaid
-- legacy statements are superseded and their bookings return to accumulation.

  'Atomically freezes every unclaimed fee earned through an exact server cutoff. Court owners may call only when the next 14th cycle is due; owners may record a reasoned override.';
comment on function public.submit_booking_fee_remittance(uuid, numeric, text, text, text, text, text) is
  'Creates immutable payment proof for all or part of a remittance. Proof must already exist in the private remittance-proofs bucket.';
comment on function public.review_booking_fee_remittance_payment(uuid, text, numeric, text, text) is
  'System-owner-only review. Accepted value reduces the frozen balance; rejected proof remains permanently auditable.';
comment on function public.cancel_booking_fee_remittance(uuid, text, text) is
  'Recovery for an unpaid prepared/rejected batch. System owners may cancel any eligible batch; a court owner may cancel only the batch they prepared. Items are released without deleting history.';
